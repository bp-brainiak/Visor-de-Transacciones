If you can't find the icons you're looking for included with 
Visual Studio's image library, there are plenty of free icon 
packs available on the Internet. 
Several of the other posts mention their picks, but I'm a huge 
fan of Fugue Icons. Similar to the Silk icons, 
they're free for use in your applications as long 
as you provide attribution. Otherwise, you can purchase a 
royalty-free license for a very reasonable price.
